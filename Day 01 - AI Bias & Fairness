Day 1 - Summary
Today I learned what AI bias really means  and honestly, it’s more human than technical.  
AI gets its “mind” from the data we train it with, so any bias in society can slip into the model without anyone noticing.

What stood out to me:
1 Bias isn’t always intentional.
2 Even well-trained models can make unfair decisions.
3 AI learns from us, so if our data is messy, biased, or incomplete… the model will be too.

It made me realise why fairness matters so much in responsible AI.

 Reflection
My biggest takeaway today:

AI bias is not just a code issue it’s a society issue.  

Humans create the data, humans decide what to label, and humans set the rules.  
So if the world is biased, the model will learn those biases too.

This made the whole topic feel very real and very important.
